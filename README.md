# Mini_project_Bank
The first step was to clean the datal, for any incosistancies, like blank spaces, anamolies outliers etc.
Step two was to do a basic EDA to understand what the information being presented had to say.
In the next steps I prepared the data for finanal model application, eg: Adding dummy variables.
Finally models where implemented: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, XG boost, Ada Boost.
The different models were compared for their different level of performance.
